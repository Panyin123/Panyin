		            Chapter Six of Ghana’s constitution on “directive principles of state policy”
		            provides the basic expectations from a government and what should be accomplished by the state, 
		            however, each government employs its own strategy and approach in responding to these development expectations.
		            The current government in its manifesto, which obtained an overwhelming mandate of the electorate, promised to 
		            facilitate growth, create job opportunities and ensure prosperity for all through the pivotal role of the private
		            sector in production. The government also pledged to develop strategic economic and social interventions over the
		            short to medium-term period to create a suitable environment for savings and investment.  It must however be 
		            recognized that the process of linking the vision through policy to implementation requires a formidable planning
		            process, to produce cogent plans and sustainable programmes. The plans and programmes should not only be technically 
		            sound but must also receive the required political buy-in and commitment from the leadership of Government.
		            The Ministry of Planning (MoP) therefore plays a key role in linking the technical output of planning to the necessary
		            political decision-making platform, which is given expression through the public investment programmes and the national budget.
		            The Minister for Planning, thus requires a highly technical and formidable Secretariat to assist in coordinating of national policies,
		            harmonizing intended actions into concerted plans and programmes, and liaising with the respective sector heads and Office of the President
		            in developing a corresponding public investment portfolio for implementation and plan reviews. It is also to ensure that the national development
		            trajectory also falls in tandem with and be guided by international development targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Agenda 2063.  
                    The shift of the development paradigm from a fiscal-laden economy to one emphasizing production and job creation requires a deliberate short to medium-term framework
                    that will respond to the new trajectory and detailed-out programmes and actions in the respective sector and district plans for implementation and delivery. 
                    This requires an input of high technical acumen and political influence to drive, and the OMFP is indeed charting this new direction. 
                    The Minister for Planning, supported by his technical team will ensure a well-coordinated policy regime, which captures the vision of the President,
                    the development strategy of the government and the aspirations of the people of Ghana, to serve as the basis for the public investment programme and the national budget.
                    The vision, strategies and aspirations are to be converted into clear technical policies with defined targets and actions for implementation. 
                    The development planning function within the Office of the Minister for Planning is required for strengthening policy planning, development management and ensuring the viability of public investments.
                    This Office thus provides the necessary expertise in fulfilling the key technical and political lead for development planning, coordination and provide the needed documentation and prompt development
                    information for the President’s Cabinet and the Economic Management Team (EMT). The Minister for Planning, besides being a member of the EMT is also specifically responsible for developing the Coordinated
                    Programme for Economic and Social Development Policy (CPESDP), a National Medium-Term Development Framework to guide the sectors and local governments and the National Medium-Term Development Plan, which
                    harmonizes the sectors and local governments’ development plans into a concerted and integrated national policy and action plans for the medium-term.
                    The annual action plans, rolling out from the Medium-Term Development Plan is a key input to the national budget. The OMFP also enhances the collective efficiency and effectiveness of public investments 
                    by providing thorough analysis for financial viability, economic feasibility, environmental sustainability and particularly the effect on inclusive growth. The assessed public investments are prioritized 
                    and coordinated with the development of a Public Investment Programme Portfolio (PIPP), which is then presented to the Ministry of Finance as a vital input to the national budget process. 
                    The Office of the Minister for Planning thus facilitates the establishment of the Vision of the Government, manage the political-technical interface for national planning and undertakes processes 
                    to ensure the efficiency, effectiveness and coordination of public investments for attaining inclusive growth.
