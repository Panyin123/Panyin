		        Elmina Castle was erected by the Portuguese in 1482 as São Jorge da Mina (St. George of the Mine) Castle,
		        also known simply as Mina or Feitoria da Mina) in present-day Elmina, Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast). 
		        It was the first trading post built on the Gulf of Guinea, so is the oldest European building in existence
		        south of the Sahara. First established as a trade settlement, the castle later became one of the most important
		        stops on the route of the Atlantic slave trade. The Dutch seized the fort from the Portuguese in 1637, and took
		        over all the Portuguese Gold Coast in 1642. The slave trade continued under the Dutch until 1814; in 1872,
		        the Dutch Gold Coast, including the fort, became a possession of the British Empire.
		        Britain granted the Gold Coast its independence in 1957, and control of the castle was transferred to the nation
		        formed out of the colony, present-day Ghana. Today Elmina Castle is a popular historical site, and was a major
		        filming location for Werner Herzog's 1987 drama film Cobra Verde. The castle is recognized by UNESCO as a World
		        Heritage Site.
		        The people living along the West African coast at Elmina around the fifteenth century were presumably Fante.
		        The Fante ethnicity bears an uncertain relationship to "Akan," itself a word connoting originality from the root word, "
		        kan", to be first or original. Among their ancestors were merchants and miners trading gold into the Mediterranean and
		        Near Eastern worlds from medieval times. The ancestors of the Akan-speakers of the forests however undoubtedly came from 
		        north of the forest.
		        The people on the West African coast were organized into numerous populations that were drawn according to kinship lines.
		        Family was extremely important in society, and family heads were united in communities under a recognized local authority.
		        Along the Gold Coast alone, more than twenty independent kingdom-states existed. Elmina lay between two different Fante
		        kingdoms, Fetu and Eguafo. West Africans nurtured ancient connections to other parts of the world. Common metals trade,
		        iconic artistic forms, and agricultural borrowing show that trans-Saharan and regional coastal connections thrived. 
		        The Portuguese in 1471 were the first Europeans to visit the Gold Coast as such, but not necessarily the first sailors 
		        to reach the port

			    Located directly east of the Korle Lagoon, Jamestown and Usshertown are the oldest districts in the city of Accra,
			    Ghana and emerged as communities around the 17th century British James Fort and Ussher Fort on the Gulf of Guinea
			    coast.[1] These districts were heavily developed by the end of the 19th century, and following the rapid growth of 
			    the city during the 20th century, they became areas of a dense mixture of commercial and residential use.
	            Today, both Jamestown and Usshertown remain fishing communities inhabited primarily by the Ga. Although in
	            a state of decay following years of neglect by subsequent governments, the districts are popular tourist destinations
	            for those seeking to see the remnants of Accra's colonial past. The original Jamestown Light, built by the British at James Fort in 1871, 
	            was replaced in the 1930s by the current Accra Light, which is 28 m (92 ft) tall. The light, which is 34 metres (112 ft) above sea level, 
	            has a visibility of 16 nautical miles (30 km).[2]
	            Since World War II, a succession of plans to enhance the capital city have come with changes in government — 
	            some seeing improvements in Jamestown as a necessary part of the overall plan, and some treating such improvements as competing with the 
	            efforts to develop the central business district of Accra. Currently, plans are afoot to re-develop the districts of Jamestown and Usshertown,
	            both of which constitute Old Accra or "Ga-Mashie" with the inauguration of the 2015 Old Accra Strategy. The Popular Azonto dance originated from James Town

				<h2>Kwame nkrumah mausoleum</h2>

				The Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum and memorial park is located in downtown Accra, the capital of Ghana.
	            It is dedicated to the prominent Ghanaian leader Kwame Nkrumah.
	            The mausoleum designed by Don Aurthur, houses the body of Dr Kwame Nkrumah and his wife Fathia Nkrumah,
	            it is meant to represent an upside down sword which in the Akan culture is a symbol of peace. The mausoleum
	            is clad from top to bottom with Italian marble, with a black star at its apex to symbolize unity. The interior
	            of the Mausoleum boasts marble flooring and a mini mastaba looking marble grave marker surrounded by river washed rocks.
	            A skylight at the top in the Mausoleum illuminates the grave, and at the right time, seems to reflect off the marble
	            further emphasizing that beauty many have come to fall in love with.
	            The Mausoleum is surrounded by water which is a symbol of life. Its presence conveys a sense of immortality for the name
	            Nkrumah. It shows that even in death he lives on in the hearts and minds of generations here and generations yet to come.

				<h2>lake Botwe</h2>

				Lake Bosumtwi (rightly spelled Bosomtwe) is the only natural lake in Ashanti and Ghana. 
				It is situated within an ancient impact crater that is about 10.5 kilometres (6.5 mi) in diameter. 
				It is about 30 km south-east of Kumasi the capital of Ashanti and is a popular recreational area. 
				There are about 30 villages near crater lake Lake Bosumtwi, with a combined population of about 70,000 
				Ashanti people.
                The Ashanti consider Bosumtwi a sacred lake. According to traditional belief, the souls of the dead come
                here to bid farewell to the god Asase Ya. Because of this, it is considered permissible to fish in the lake
                only from wooden planks. Among the fish species in the lake is the endemic cichlid Hemichromis frempongi,
                and the near-endemic cichlids Tilapia busumana and T. discolor.
                The Lake Bosumtwi impact crater is 10.5 km in diameter, slightly larger than the present lake which is approximately
                8 kilometres (5.0 mi) across, and is estimated to be 1.07 million years old (Pleistocene period).[7][8] There is a highly
                speculative theory that connects this event to the short-term Jaramillo geomagnetic reversal.[9]
                Depth of crater is approximately 380 m, but, if counted together with the depth of lake sediments - 750 m.[10]
                The crater has been partly eroded, and is situated in dense rainforest, making it difficult to study and confirm its origin
                by meteorite impact. Shock features such as shatter cones are largely overgrown by vegetation or covered by the lake.
                However, drilling of the crater's central uplift beneath the lake floor has recently provided an abundance of shocked materials
                for scientific study. Tektites, believed to be from this impact, are found in the neighbouring country of Ivory Coast, and
                related microtektites have been found in deep sea sediments west of the African continent.

				<h2>Web Du Bois</h2>

				William Edward Burghardt "W. E. B." Du Bois (pronounced /duːˈbɔɪz/ doo-BOYZ; February 23, 1868 – August 27,
				1963) was an American sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer and editor.
				Born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and integrated community.
				After completing graduate work at the University of Berlin and Harvard, where he was the first African American 
				to earn a doctorate, he became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University. Du Bois was
				one of the co-founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.
                Du Bois rose to national prominence as the leader of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists 
                who wanted equal rights for blacks. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by Booker T.
                Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed 
                that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased
                political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this
                group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.
                Racism was the main target of Du Bois's polemics, and he strongly protested against lynching, Jim Crow laws, and discrimination in
                education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent
                of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers.
                Du Bois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American black soldiers in France
                and documented widespread bigotry in the United States military.
                Du Bois was a prolific author. His collection of essays, The Souls of Black Folk, was a seminal work in African-American 
                literature; and his 1935 magnum opus Black Reconstruction in America challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were
                responsible for the failures of the Reconstruction Era. He wrote one of the first scientific treatises in the field of 
                American sociology, and he published three autobiographies, each of which contains insightful essays on sociology, politics
                and history. In his role as editor of the NAACP's journal The Crisis, he published many influential pieces. Du Bois believed
                that capitalism was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. 
                He was an ardent peace activist and advocated nuclear disarmament. The United States' Civil Rights Act, embodying many of the 
                reforms for which Du Bois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted a year after his death.
