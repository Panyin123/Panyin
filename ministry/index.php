                    Chapter Six of Ghana’s constitution on “directive principles of state policy” 
                    provides the basic expectations from a government and what should be accomplished by the state, 
                    however, each government employs its own strategy and approach in responding to these development expectations. 
                    The current government in its manifesto, which obtained an overwhelming mandate of the electorate, promised to 
                    facilitate growth, create job opportunities and ensure prosperity for all through the pivotal role of the private
                    sector in production. The government also pledged to develop strategic economic and social interventions over the 
                    short to medium-term period to create a suitable environment for savings and investment.
