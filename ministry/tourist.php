				<h2>Cape Coast Castle</h2>
				<img src="tourist/capecoast castle.jpg" title="Cape Coast Castle" height="600px" width="900px">
				<p>
	                Ghana's Atlantic coast is lined with old forts and castles built by various European powers during the 17th century.
	                Of these, the Cape Coast Castle is one of the largest. It was built in 1653 for the Swedish Africa Company and 
	                originally used as a trading post for the timber and gold industries. It was expanded by the Dutch and the British
	                and served as an important holding station for slaves bound for the Americas. The Cape Coast Castle is now a museum
	                full of information about the history of Ghana, the slave trade, and local culture. Tours take you through the 
	                dungeons and the "door of no return", through which the castle's slaves would once have passed.

				<h2>Saint George Castle</h2>

				<p>
	                A 20-minute drive west of Cape Coast Castle brings you to the picturesque fishing town of Elmina. 
	                Elmina is home to one of Ghana's most important historic landmarks, St. George's Castle. 
	                The stark beauty of the castle's white-washed walls contrasts with its dark history.
	                Built by the Portuguese in 1482, it was captured by the Dutch 150 years later. 
	                It served for more than two centuries as the headquarters of the Dutch West India Company. 
	                Gold exports were soon replaced by slaves, and today tours through the dungeons give visitors
	                an emotional insight into the trade and the horrors it entailed. Nearby Fort St. Jago lies across 
	                the lagoon and offers excellent views of the castle and Elmina town.

				<p>
	                Ghana's vibrant capital is a sprawling city with over two million residents.
	                It constitutes an eclectic blend of contemporary architecture, ramshackle townships,
	                colonial castles and lively markets, and is considered one of Africa's safest capital
	                cities. Highlights include the Makola Market, a central hub selling everything from 
	                fresh produce to local arts and crafts; and the National Museum. The latter houses wonderful
	                displays focusing on Ghanaian culture and history, including the legacies of the Ashanti Kingdom
	                and the slave trade. Accra also has several scenic beaches, including Labadi Beach, Coco Beach and
	                Bojo Beach

				<h2>Kakum National Park</h2>
				<img src="tourist/kakum National park.jpg" title="kakum National park" height="600px" width="900px">
				<p>
	               Kakum National Park is a dense tropical rainforest in southern Ghana. 
	               The forest is home to more than 40 mammal species including forest elephants,
	                forest buffalo, meerkats, and civets. The birdlife is fantastic as well with over 
	                250 different species recorded. The highlight of any visit to Kakum, however, is a stroll 
	                on the Canopy Walkway. Suspended 100 feet/30 meters above the ground, it crosses several 
	                bridges and is over 1150 feet/350 meters long. The walkway offers a unique perspective of
	                the park's flora and fauna. Make sure to take a guided tour for a better understanding of 
	                the plants' many medicinal properties. There's a basic campsite for those who want to stay overnight.

				<h2>Mole national Park</h2>
				<img src="tourist/mole national park.jpg" title="mole national park" height="600px" width="900px">
				<p>
	                Located in northwest Ghana, Mole National Park is the country's largest wildlife park. Here, 
	                you can expect to see buffalo, rare roan antelope, elephants, warthogs, hyenas and if you're very lucky,
	                leopard. Lions have recently been re-introduced to the park as well. Birders can also keep an eye out for
	                more than 250 avian species. You can opt for a walking safari or a traditional game drive accompanied by 
	                an armed guide. There's a motel just near the park headquarters. The best time to spot wildlife is during
	                the dry season (January-March) when animals congregate around the water sources. On your way to Mole, visit
	                the nearby Larabanga Mosque, the oldest mosque in Ghana.

	               used to live, check out the Manhyia Palace Museum . If you time it right, you can meet the current Ashanti king here;
